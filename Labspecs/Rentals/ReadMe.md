# Rentals




## Business Process Overview

> *Employees must log onto the system. Rentals must only allow authenicated users within the Rental Role to have access to the subsystem. An Associate or Department Head create rentals. The Employee full name must appear on the form in text mode*

The Rentals component requires the renter to have a customer record before the rental is done. You can assume this record exists. A rental record is created along with the rental detail(s) (each reflects a piece of rented equipment). Each rental of equipment is independent of previous rentals. Coupons are presented at the time of rental. Customers return rented equipment, it is checked, comments recorded and the rental is paid. Customers do **not do** partial returns. If the rental period for equipment is expected to be different, then separate rentals are created. Example: the customer expects to rent equipment a, b, c and d; a, b and c for 1 day but piece d for a week. Two rental contracts will be created; one for a, b, and c; one for piece d. The smallest rental period is 1/2 day. A customer must be in good standing to rent equipment

### Renting

A customer will enter the rental area, approach the rental counter and request one or more pieces of equipment. Once the associate determines the equipment is available, the rental checkout process starts. The customer is asked for their phone number and their information is displayed. From the list of available equipment, a particular piece is selected (serial number is vertified manually). This equipment is added to the rental. Any piece can be remove from the rental or the entire rental cancelled if the customer changes their mind. Equipment is checked before the customer leaves with the equipment to ensure it is in working order. The associate will demonstrate how to use the equipment. Payment is done at when the equipment is returned.
