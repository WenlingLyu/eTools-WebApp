# Deliverable 1 - **Development Planning**

In the `ReadMe.md` at the root of your repository, include each team member's full name and GitHub username along with their chosen/assigned subsystem name.

## Milestones and Issues

In GitHub, create serveral **milestones** representing project deliverables with the assigned due dates. The milestones should be set up along both shared and individual responsibilities for this project. For the first two deliverables, each will have a milestone for their own selected scenario directed at the deliverable. *E.g.: If your scenario is "Sales", then you will have these milestones:*

- **Sales Development Plan** - Your [*implementation plan*](#implementation-plan) for the first deliverable
- **Sales Subsystem TRX Service methods** - The working implementation of the Sales Subsystem transactional service methods.

For the [**Final Solution**](./Deliverable-3.md) milestones will consist of 1 milestone for group work and one for each individual scenario. The group work milestone will have a series of issues associated with the work distributed amongst the whole team for the shared component **Project Setup**. In addition, for each team member, they will need create a milestone related to their specific scenario. *E.g.: If your scenario is "Sales", then you will have these extra milestones:*

- **Sales Subsystem** - The working implementation of the Sales Subsystem (the last deliverable)

Your Issues are to be associated with the approriate milestone that you generate for your work. All of your work in this lab is to be associated with git commits that reference your GitHub Issue(s). Your instructor will be using these to track your progress and participation in this project.

## Planning Document

The remaining part of this *Development Planning* deliverable is where you document *your* plan for how you will implement *your* chosen scenario.

> You are expected to make **regular** and **frequent** commits while working on this project. **Begin early** to ensure that you have enough time to complete this group project!

## Implementation Plan

Create an initial issue where you document your overall implementation plan. This implementation plan for your scenario must address the following areas of concern. You can detail your thoughts on each area as comments to this initial issue. **Use the Planning Document exercise as a blue print for this deliverable.**

- **UI Design Implementation**
  - Identify HTML elements for various parts of the UI
  - Identify which buttons/links trigger POST and GET requests
  - Include mock-up images of the user interface
- **Data Modelling**
  - Identify the distinct data models for the **command** and **query** aspects of the UI Design needs and the business processing needs of the system
- **Business Processing**
  - Identify specific method signatures that you would need to create for the Business Logic Layer (BLL), including the parameter types and return type of the methods.
  - For each BLL method, identify the tables/entities you will need to work with; a high-level process outline of work; along with any important business processing requirements for the method (business rules, validation, etc.).

The description of the issue should include a high-level Task-List of work that would need to be done. These task-list items can then be turned into their own issues for the [coding phase](./Deliverable-3.md) of the project.
